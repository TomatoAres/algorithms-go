# 面试策略

## 简历

总之：信息明确，清晰

1. Multiple Columns: Multiple columns make it easier for someone to skim your
company name, positions, collage, and other key facts.
2. Brief: Interviewer is going to spend about 30 Sec reading your resume. You
should just focus on the highlights. One page is all you need, but if you are 10+
years of experience, then you can justify two pages.
3. No Junk: No objective, No oath, Summary section/Key skills section may be
fine, if your resume is short and concise then you do not need a summary section.
4. Use Tables: You can use tables, but it should not waste space.
5. Highlights: highlights should be short. Keep your highlights to one-liner.
6. Neat: Keep your resume neat and clean. Use appropriate Fonts and Formatting.
Bold to represent highlights and maybe italics in some places.
